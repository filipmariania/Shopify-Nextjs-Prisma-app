# Shopify Next.js x Prisma Boilerplate

An embedded app starter template to get up and ready with Shopify app development with Next.js and Prisma.

I've included [notes](/docs/NOTES.md) on this repo which goes over the repo on why certain choices were made.

## Video

I made a video that goes over the entire repo, creating theme extension and deploying with Vercel and PlanetScale. If you want to learn Shopify app dev in-depth, I also sell a course _[How To Build Shopify Apps](https://kinngh.gumroad.com/l/how-to-make-shopify-apps?utm_source=github&utm_medium=nextjs-repo)_

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 13
- Prisma ORM

## Why I made this

Building with Express and React was great but eventually there comes a time where you have to remind yourself that you need to get on with the times and use what's new and stable. Serverless made sense, and Next.js made even more.
