An embedded app starter template to get up and ready with Shopify app development with Next.js and Prisma.

I've included [notes](/docs/NOTES.md) on this repo which goes over the repo on why certain choices were made.

## Video

I made a video that goes over the entire repo, creating theme extension and deploying with Vercel and PlanetScale.

## Supporting repositories

- [`@kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app`](https://github.com/kinngh/shopify-node-express-mongodb-app): Shopify app starter repo built with Express.js, React.js and Vite.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 13
- Prisma (Postgresql)

## Why I made this

Building with Express and React was great but eventually there comes a time where you have to remind yourself that you need to get on with the times and use what's new and stable. Serverless made sense, and Next.js made even more.

## Notes

- Refer to [SETUP](/docs/SETUP.md)
- The project comes with snippets to speed up development. Refer to [Snippets](/docs/SNIPPETS.md).
