# Snippets

A collection of snippets to quickly create further boilerplate code with relevant functions and checks.

I selected these snippets from my regular use and code that I was writing over and over again. Instead of again including a `__templates/` directory that was causing a lot of confusion, it made more sense to add this as a workspace snippet library instead. This also avoided the issue of creating and maintaining extensions.

If you don't want the snippets, delete the [snippets file](../.vscode/snippets.code-snippets)
